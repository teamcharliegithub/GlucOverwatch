# GlucOverwatch

GlucOverwatch is an application that alerts patients and caregivers to hypoglycemia and allows patients to summon aid if necessary.

## Motivation

In the US alone, there are nearly 2 million people with Type 1 diabetes. This chronic condition causes the pancreas to produce little or no insulin, meaning that patients require external insulin to survive. However, external insulin administration can lead to hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, a potentially life-threatening condition which requires immediate treatment.

Glucose monitoring companies have already developed devices to track blood glucose levels continuously, as well as services that allow caregivers to monitor blood glucose trends in real-time. However, there remains a lack of services that allow patient and caregiver to communicate treatment of hypoglycemia or the need for assistance. 


## Solution

GlucOverwatch monitors blood glucose values continuously. When low blood glucose is detected, the program sends an SMS message to the patient, asking whether the patient has treated or is in need of aid. If the patient has treated, the program will send an SMS message to a caregiver informing them of treatment; if the patient requests aid, the caregiver will receive a message informing them that their patient requires assistance as soon as possible.

**GlucOverwatch is not currently functional due to issues with Flask.**
